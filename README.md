# Museum Events

## Description

This web based CRUD application shows events that take place in Museums. It lists the events
and when clicked on shows the name of the museum and a brief description. User can view events and add an event.


## Wireframes and User Stories

* User is in home page, clicks on VIEW MUSEMS button and will be redirected to events page.
* User clicks on any event of her/his interest which will redirect them to view mor information.
* The user will be viewing details about the event, such as the name of the event, location, and a description.
*The user will also be able to ADD an event or DELETE one. 

## Technologies Used

* HTML /EJS
* Node/ Express
* MVC Pattern
* SQL
* CSS 

## Improvements/ Adjustments

I'll need to get the individual event to display more information when clicked on. I plan on adding an API that allows the user to view events that are coming up in that specific museum. The name of the event, date, and description will display. I also plan on adding a picture of the museum next to the name of the event.
